# üß´ In-Vitro-Plate-Assay
The interaction between 16 different yeast isolates belonging to various classes of basidiomycetes yeasts and six different bacterial isolates, isolated from various hosts, was studied using a specialized in-vitro plate assay. This assay was designed to identify different types of interactions, including contact-dependent, distance-dependent (via agar-diffusible compounds), and distance-independent (via volatile compounds) interactions. To assess that following type of assays were conducted.  

## Co-Culture Plate Assay
 Each plate contained eight 3 Œºl drops of yeast and bacteria arranged in diagonal rows positioned at increasing distances inside a 100 mm petri dish containing YePD agar medium, forming the shape of a ‚ÄúV‚Äù. At the apex, the microbe drops were placed in direct contact to determine any contact-dependent interactions. At the same time, the distance between colonies increased as the drops diverged to determine contact-independent interactions, such as diffusible compounds or volatile interactions.

| **distance_to_yeast**(mm)  | Categorical | Distance between yeast and bacterial colony on the plate          |

**Each row = one colony** 
Each replicate has 8 colonies measured at different distances

## In-vitro Split Plate Assay
This was done for the confirmation of the volatile interactions. Since the previous co-culture experiment could not rule out the role of volatiles versus agar diffusible compounds, we repeated selected interactions inside 100 mm Petri dishes with a bifurcation, which physically separated the yeast from the bacterium, thus only allowing interactions via volatile metabolites. Since the Methylobacterium platani had a prominent impact due to yeast volatiles we moved forward with Methylobacterum with its most interaction with the yeast.

## üìä Statistical Analysis Workflow
The analyses were conducted in R, using tidyverse-based data wrangling and statistical modeling tools:



Data Cleaning: dplyr, tidyr

Statistical Testing: rstatix for ANOVA and post hoc tests

Modeling: lm, emmeans for marginal means

Visualization: ggplot2, ggpubr

Post Hoc Interpretation: multcompView for compact letter displays

Each .Rmd file is reproducible and includes:

Data import and cleaning

Summary statistics

ANOVA models and assumptions

Post hoc comparisons

Figures and tables for publication

üîÅ Reproducibility
All Excel files are converted to .csv for compatibility and ease of import.

- Code is fully annotated for clarity.

Versioning is maintained via Git.

Raw data, metadata, and analysis scripts will be archived and made public post-publication.
